Install a node dependency tree on disk.

The installation is done using a flat folder structure where packages are
connected with symlinks. This package is meant to be used as a component of a
package manager.

Features:

- Install packages in a flat structure.
- Install bin scripts.
- Support package names with a namespace.
- Multiple packages can have the same name (usefull to support various version
  or conflicting peerDependencies).

Usage:

```javascript
const { installLocalStore } = require("local-package-store");

const location = "<path to an empty folder>";
const dependencyGraph = {
  nodes: [
    {
      key: "1",
      location: "location where the uninstalled package is on disk",
    },
    {
      key: "2",
      location: "location where the uninstalled package is on disk",
    },
  ],
  links: [{ source: "1", target: "2" }],
};

installLocalStore(dependencyGraph, location).then(() => {
  /* Installation is done */
});
```

The inputs are:

- The dependency graph of packages. Contains a list of packages and a list of
  dependencies between them.
- The location of a store. This is where the packages will be installed on disk.
